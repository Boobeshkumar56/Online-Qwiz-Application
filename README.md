## **Overview**

The **Web3 Online Quiz Application** is a decentralized platform that allows users to participate in quizzes while earning rewards in the form of tokens or NFTs. Built on blockchain technology, it offers a secure and transparent environment for users to engage in fun and educational quizzes.

Users can:

- Get rewarded with tokens or NFTs based on quiz performance.
- Use a Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the application.

## **Features**

- **Decentralized User Authentication**: Use blockchain-based identity via wallets (e.g., MetaMask).
- **Immutable Quiz Data**: Quizzes and results are stored on decentralized platforms (IPFS).
- **Token Rewards**: Earn tokens or NFTs by participating in and performing well in quizzes.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Quizzes are processed securely and transparently on the blockchain.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is mobile-friendly and highly accessible.

## **Tech Stack**

### **Frontend**
- **React.js** or **Next.js** (for building the user interface)
- **Web3.js** or **Ethers.js** (to connect to the blockchain)
- **Tailwind CSS** or **Bootstrap** (for styling)

### **Backend/Blockchain**
- **Ethereum** (or any EVM-compatible chain like Polygon or Binance Smart Chain)
- **Solidity** (smart contract development)
